When Procurement negotiates a contract for instance they will have first found a supplier, developed that relationship, audited and qualified the supplier, conducted a quotation process, then awarded the business to that supplier. Purchasing can then place Purchase Orders against that
contract, track vendor performance, and deal with daily issues related to delivery, quality, and anything else that comes up.
